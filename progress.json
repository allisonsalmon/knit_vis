Ended up doing only 15 rounds of ribbing and started the left sleeve. This is going to be close!</p>\n\n<p>Day 13 - Almost done with the right arm, started the ribbing. I&#8217;m going to do 20 rounds of ribbing with plans to do an owl on the cuff of the left arm.</p>\n\n<p>Day 12 - Right arm. 10 rounds = 2 inches in my gauge. I am knitting 10 rounds and then decreasing. About 1/2 way done.</p>\n\n<p>Day 11 - Finished the body! It fits perfectly. I started the right arm but didn&#8217;t get very far.</p>\n\n<p>Day 10 - not much time to knit.

I got a little nervous it wasn&#8217;t going to fit and I wasn&#8217;t sure when to start the decrease so I tried it on again. It fits great and it&#8217;s time to start the decreases!</p>\n\n<p>Day 5 - Split the arms and am working down the body. Started my second ball of yarn and am trying to figure out where to start the waist shaping. I had a bit of a panic thinking it might be a little small, checked my gauge and I think I will be OK. It will be a close fitting sweater though.</p>\n\n<p>Day 4 - finished the yoke, put it on scrap yarn to try it on. I marked the middle of the back short rows and then puzzled over the splitting math. I think I am going to go with 58 on the back, 36 for each sleeve and 50 on the front. I will cast on 4 stitches under each arm provisionally to get picked up later and knitted into the arm.</p>\n\n<p>Day 3 - Almost through with the Owl cables!</p>\n\n<p>Day 2 - Didn&#8217;t get much done, I needed to switch to a longer cable needle and didn&#8217;t have one on hand until the evening. I managed to knit down through the Owls heads.</p>\n\n<p>Day 1 - Puzzled over how to do the short rows in reverse of the pattern. Think I figured it out.</p>\n\n<p>Opening ceremony - Decided to attempt this top down instead of bottom up. Cast-on twice.
